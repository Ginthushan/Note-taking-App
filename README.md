## Overview
Our goal of this project is to design a mobile device app that is specifically for Ontario Tech students to use. Students can use their student ID to login into this app, and it will bring out all the course information that the students are currently enrolled in. And inside the app, students can create study notes, exam notes or personal notes for each of their courses. Therefore we want to design a utility application that is specially designed for Ontario Tech students, since we know what students actually want to have and use in this kind of mobile device app.

User's guide
● Step 1: First when user opens the application, it will shows user the Login page


● Step 2: If a user hasn't registered an account within our database, then the user will need to click the registration button and register an account in our database. If the user already have an account, skip step 3 and move on to the step 4


● Step 3: After clicking the register button, it will ask the user to input all
the courses they are enrolled in and register a password to save it.
After completing registration, it will bring back the user to the login
page and the user can login to their account.


● Step 4: User now can click on the user name text box, and input their
student ID, then the user can click on the password text box, and can
input their password that user registered for this account. And if the
ID and password matches with what we have in our database, then
the login is successful and will bring the user to the course page
which shows all the courses that the user input when they register. If
login failed, it means that one of the 2 following situations happened:
1) The user’s ID or password is incorrect or 2) User did not register
an account with this ID, and the user will need to go back to step 2
and create an account.


● Step 5: After the user has successfully logged into the app, it will
bring the user to the home page and it will display all the courses that
the user has enrolled in when they registered. From here the user
can click the + icon that corresponds to the course to add note for
that course and follow step 6 or at the top area underneath the
“Home Page” text, the user can click on the map icon and it will bring
the user to the map page and can follow step 9.


● Step 6: After the user clicks on the + button, it will bring the user to
the note page, which will show a list of notes that the user had
created for this course. Initially it will be an empty list, but users can
add as many notes as they want to this list. User can click on the +
button on the bottom right corner and it will bring the user to the
noteDetail page and the user can follow step 7 to create a note. Or
the user can click on any existing note and it will bring the user to the
noteDetail page and the user can edit the note following step 8. Users
can also click on the red recycle button and delete the note that is
corresponding to the button.


● Step 7:  In this page users can click on the title text box and input the
title they want for this note. Users can click on the big note text box
and input all the notes that the user wants to input. After all is done,
the user can click on the save button on the bottom right corner and it
will save the note locally and bring the user back to the note page for
this course.


● Step 8: In this page users can click on the big note text box and edit
the notes that the user wants to edit. After all is done, the user can
click on the save button on the bottom right corner and it will save the
edit locally and overwrite the old note then bring the user back to the
note page for this course.


● Step 9: In this page, it will show the user a map of its current location,
user can click on the location button on the bottom right and it will
save the current location of the where the user is at as a list of
favorite study places. Users can also move the map around and save
that location as their favorite place as well.
