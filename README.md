## Overview
Our goal of this project is to design a mobile device app that is specifically for Ontario Tech students to use. Students can use their student ID to login into this app, and it will bring out all the course information that the students are currently enrolled in. And inside the app, students can create study notes, exam notes or personal notes for each of their courses. Therefore we want to design a utility application that is specially designed for Ontario Tech students, since we know what students actually want to have and use in this kind of mobile device app.
